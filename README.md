## Using Python programming to web scrape jobs offers
I made the first version of this program for jobsearch on Indeed. I expect to release a new version that will be also compatible to LinkedIn. Among the packages I've used to build this program: `Selenium`, `Beautiful Soup`, `lxml`, `Pandas`, and `Tkinter`.
